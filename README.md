# Movies-Recommender-System
This is a recommender system applied in two different approaches: 1) Simple model  2) Neural Network based model Both models outperform the academic benchmarks with few epochs of training, with the second gives state of the art like results.  I use the famous Movielens mini dataset in this project, which has users' ratings of movies. The aim of the project is to showcase a simple recommender system which is able to predict which movies certain user would probably like most by looking at what similar users liked. I used keras library as the core backbone for this project.
